  <h1>Ninth Amendment Restoration</h1>
  <p class="subtitle">
    A proposed constitutional amendment clarifying that the Ninth Amendment protects enforceable retained rights,
    and that lack of historical recognition is not a veto.
  </p>
</header>

<main>
  <section>
    <h2>The Problem</h2>
    <p>
      The Ninth Amendment is routinely treated as a slogan rather than a rule of construction with legal consequence.
      In practice, courts and litigants often behave as if rights must be enumerated, historically popular, or already
      recognized to be enforceable. That approach reverses the Ninth Amendment’s logic.
    </p>
    <p>
       Enumeration is not exhaustion.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>What This Proposal Does</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Affirms that unenumerated retained rights exist and are not “denied by silence.”</li>
      <li>Clarifies that “no historical analogue” is not, by itself, dispositive.</li>
      <li>Bars the federal government and the States from abridging retained rights because they are unenumerated.</li>
      <li>Preserves Fourteenth Amendment protections and confirms self-execution.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Proposed Amendment</h2>
    <blockquote>
      <p><strong>Section 1.</strong> The enumeration in this Constitution of certain rights shall not be construed to deny, disparage, limit, or exhaust other rights retained by the people.</p>
<p><strong>Section 2.</strong> Such retained rights include, but are not limited to, rights necessary to personal autonomy, bodily integrity, family life, expressive freedom, and participation in civic society.</p>
<p>The absence of historical recognition shall not, by itself, be sufficient to deny the existence or enforcement of a right retained by the people.</p>
<p><strong>Section 3.</strong> Neither the United States nor any State shall abridge, deny, or infringe the rights retained by the people on the ground that such rights are not expressly enumerated in this Constitution.</p>
<p><strong>Section 4.</strong> Nothing in this Amendment shall be construed to diminish or impair the protections guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment, including the guarantees of equal protection and due process of law.</p>
<p><strong>Section 5.</strong> This Amendment is self-executing. No legislative action shall be required to give it force or effect, and no court shall decline to adjudicate a claim arising under this Amendment on the ground that Congress has not enacted implementing legislation.</p>
<p><strong>Section 6.</strong> Congress shall have power to enforce this Amendment by appropriate legislation, which shall be supplementary to, and not a prerequisite for, judicial enforcement.</p>
